# Real Time Rendering Experiments
This repository contains different experiments I made regarding real time computer graphics, using OpenGL and C++.
I do this to get an insight of the domain, and so far I enjoy a lot that mix of computer science, maths, physics and art.
My main source of info up to this point is [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/), I visited [ScratchAPixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/) to implement basic noise functions.
I recently started [Real Time Rendering 4th edition](http://www.realtimerendering.com/), with the aim of going through the book to deepen my theoretical knowledge and implementing some of those rendering techniques.
